Hi my name is Stijn Voss. I am a student computer science living in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. During high school I got involved in (mostly back-end) web development as a hobby and a side job. 

Later on during my study computer science I became interested in the opportunities that the field of data science seems to offer. Which is why I am currently doing the data science master's track at Radboud University. 

I am also involved in a start-up called [whichmuseum](https://whichmuseum.com) where we try to provide users with insight into museums they could visit wherever they go. In the little time I have left I do some freelance work every now and then.

In this blog I aim to share my (hopefully) interesting experiences I have at my study and other activities.
