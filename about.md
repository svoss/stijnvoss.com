I am a student computer science living in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. During high school I got involved in (mostly back-end) web development as a hobby and a side job. Currently I work a lot with amazon aws to make my applications easier to manage and more scalable.

During my study computer science I became interested in the opportunities that the field of data science seems to offer. Which is why I am currently doing the data science master's track at Radboud University. 

I am also involved in a start-up called [whichmuseum](https://whichmuseum.com). Where we try to provide users with insight into museums and related information they could visit wherever they go. In the litle time I have left I do some freelance work.

In this blog I aim to share my (hopefully) interesting experiences I have at my study and other activities.
