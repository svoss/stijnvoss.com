I am a recent graduate student computer science living in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. I started programming when I was about 11 years old and during high school I got involved in (mostly back-end) web development as a hobby and a side job. Currently I work a lot with amazon aws to make my applications easier to manage and more scalable.

During my study computer science I became interested in the opportunities that the field of data science seems to offer. In september I graduated from computing science data science master's track at Radboud University. Currently i mainly do some freelance work as web developer or data scientist. 

I am also involved in a start-up called [whichmuseum](https://whichmuseum.com). Where we try to provide users with insight into museums and related information they could visit wherever they go.

In this blog I aim to share my (hopefully) interesting experiences I have during my activities.
